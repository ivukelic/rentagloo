                Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a
                group of aquatic birds. They live almost exclusively in the
                Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Gal√°pagos
                penguin, found north of the equator. Highly adapted for life in
                the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage
                and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish,
                squid and other forms of sea life which they catch while
                swimming underwater. They spend roughly half of their lives on
                land and the other half in the sea.
